# How to contribute

## Getting Started

Fork the repository to your account. Clone the repository on your machine,
checkout to `dev` and start development.

## Rules

Always make changes on the `dev` branch. And make the pull requests to `dev`.

Don't use dependency or other libraries.

If the change requires some platform dependent code, make the same change for
other systems, don't block the project to only one platform.

Try to keep the code simple, ease to new programmer to read and change the code.
I know there are some parts with a lot of macros, but I used this only for saving
typing and trying to make clear usage.

Try to put on front of commit the action that was made on code. Like

- For add use : ADD method foo to List

- For fix use : FIX name of method foo

and so on.

## Point that I need help

- Better test coverage

- More ROM for processor, for test and for examples

- Better language pattern

- Simplify the assembly code

- Improve the documentation (almost nonexistent now)

## And finely

All help is welcome: developing, opening issues, commenting or criticizing and
using.

Thanks ðŸ§™
